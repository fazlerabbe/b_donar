  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
     - assets/images/
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
     - family: Montserrat
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-Regular.ttf
         - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-Bold.ttf
         - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-ExtraBold.ttf
         - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-Italic.ttf
         - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-Light.ttf
         - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-LightItalic.ttf
         - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-Medium.ttf
         - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-SemiBold.ttf
         - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-Thin.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
